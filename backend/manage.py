"""
Manage script intentionally removed for the initial MVP.

This repository uses the Flask CLI to run the app during early development.
If you want the manage-style commands later (migrations/seeds/run), we'll add a proper
`manage.py` or a `scripts/` folder with the helpers once the schema is stabilized.
